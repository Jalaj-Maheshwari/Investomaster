### About
This application is part of the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree].
This project was all about taking a functional app into a production ready
app.

```
Project Overview:
 You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a
 production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error
 cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization,
 adding a widget, and adding a library.

Why this Project?
 Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice
 improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will
 love. Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large
 apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common
 pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app
 experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

What Will I Learn?
 In this project, you will:

 • Diagnose existing issues with an app.
 • Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
 • Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
 • Handle error cases in Android.
 • Add a widget to your app experience.
 • Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
```

### What did I learn?

* Loaders. I'm a bit more comfortable with them now.
* Quickly create flexible layouts.
* Use MPAndroidChart, to create awesome charts.
* Collection widgets.
* Shared element transitions. That's some cool stuff.
* Much more comfortable with material design.

### Todo

* Implement search functionality to search for valid stock symbols.
* Recode the whole `QuoteSyncJob`, by using `Retrofit` and `SyncAdapters`.
* Try some `ORM` (Maybe GreenDAO), instead of `SQLITE`.
* Try fetching currency exchange rates and add it has an option or even
  better get the location and set it automatically.
